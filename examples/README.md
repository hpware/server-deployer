# Server Deployer Examples

This directory includes files that you need to include to your apps, note that if you add some of these files, Zeabur might not be able to correctly deploy your app. Vercel, Netlify and Cloudflare pages are not effected, as they can't deploy docker containers (duh). 

## Note: 
Some of these files are generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, mostly because I don't have any knowledge of building docker images. But I have glimpsed all of the files, it looks fine, and these are testing in prod... (which is not a great way to test).
